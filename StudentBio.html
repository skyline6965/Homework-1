        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p>
        Originally born in Oceanside, CA, I moved to Austin, TX in 1993. Grew up in Leander/Cedar Park area. Graduated from Leander High School in 2008.
        Played baseball a lot when I was a kid but then a lot of my friends moved over to soccer so I ended up trying soccer and being pretty good at it.
        In 2009 I met my girlfriend Vanessa, at the end of this year we will be celebrating our 10 year anny!
        In 2011 I was introduced to Disc Golf by a friend of mine and for the past 8 years I've trained and practiced to become a professional Disc Golf Player. 
        I turned pro in 2016 and played in tournaments all over Texas, Oklahoma, and California.
